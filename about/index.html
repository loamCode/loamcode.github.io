                Born and raised in Kansas, USA, I find a unique joy in seeking to
                understand of our modern food system. Food is intrinsic to civilization,
                culture, and humanity. To solve problems in this field is to investigate
                how the world works, humans and nature together. I fell in love with 
                natural systems while at Kansas State University, where I obtained a 
                Bachelor of Science in Microbiology.

                Endeavoring to become an infectious disease epidemiologist, I then
                undertook a Master in Public Health at Emory University's Rollins
                School of Public Health. While attending, I functioned as a food
                safety analyst at my practicum home site, the Georgia Department
                of Agriculture. There I became fascinated with traceback investigations.
                I felt that if we could only digitize these systems, network-based 
                technologies could ameliorate entrenched challenges in distribution,
                safety, and public health.

                In 2018, I started consulting for the Institute of Food Technologists'
                Global Food Traceability Center, a position where I would grow to become
                a known authority on standardized food traceability. I honed these skills
                at Chipotle Mexican Grill, where I led the technical implementation of
                RFID-based tracking, among other projects. In 2023, the US Food and Drug
                Administration tapped me to serve as their lead technical expert on 
                digital food traceability within the Office of the Commissoner.

                <br>
                Later in 2023, I decided that I wanted to conduct my own research activities.
                I now am a PhD Student and Research Associate the University of GÃ¶ttingen's Department of Agricultural Economics
                and Rural Development, co-supervised by Dr. Antje Risius. 
                I am also affiliated with UCL's Food Systems Research Group, under the co-supervision
                of Dr. Marco Springmann.
